WHAT THIS IS:

This is a collection of programs to drive Meltwater's add-on board for the Raspberry pi - see http://pihw.wordpress.com/meltwaters-pi-hardware-kits/rgb-led-kit/


COMPILING:

1. If you are running a revision 2 raspberry pi, edit leds.h and change PIN13 to PIN13_R2 (instead of PIN13_R1)
2. Run 'make' from the command line


RUNNING:

rainbow - displays rainbow colours by high speed switching between the LEDs. Takes the delay in microseconds as an argument, eg:

$ sudo ./rainbow 2000

shades - attempt to control the intensity of the LEDs using high speed switching. There are four levels of intensity - Fully off (0), 1/12th on (1), 4/12 on (2) and fully on (3). The LEDs are configured and displayed as 3-2-1-2-3. The colours are cycled every second also.

$ sudo ./shades

knightrider - A KITT-like sweeping led trail. Will mean nothing to you if you're born after 1980! The leading LED is full intensity, the one after it 4/12 intensity, then 1/12 intensity.

$ sudo ./knightrider

coloursweep - same as the above byt with red, yellow green

$ sudo ./coloursweep

spectrum - cycles all colours in all intensities

$ sudo ./spectrum

reset - resets all GPIO pins

$ sudo ./reset


CREDITS:

Thanks to Meltwater for designing the board (http://pihardware.com/), Carlos for making it for me (http://retrotext.blogspot.co.uk/) and Dom & Gert for providing boiler plate GPIO C code (http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#C).
